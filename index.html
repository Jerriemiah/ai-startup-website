Why was the new update to index.html not added to the main branch though?


Tom:Update on Navigations for last part of project Add an update to the sheet file so jerry can update
This is an extra update to see if the pull request works for this navigation branch

Jerry: Finally found where my problem is and understand better how to resolve it.
